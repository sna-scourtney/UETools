# UETools
Python tools for automating Unreal Engine workflows

These are tools I've created for my own use in Unreal Engine projects on Linux. While I do
try to avoid platform-specific code, these scripts are not currently tested on non-Linux
hosts. The code is shared as a starting point to make tools for your own needs and is not
intended as a finished, releasable product.

Pull requests are welcome under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause Clear license (see
[LICENSE](LICENSE) for details). Acceptance of PRs depends on a variety of factors
including whether or not they are in keeping with my own plans for the code. If your PR
is not accepted, or is modified for acceptance, it's not personal.

This code is very much a work-in-progress (WIP). In particular, the code in this GitHub
repository is a subset of a larger Python tools framework that I am creating in partnership
with my employer, and which will be released as open source under the same license as this
repository when it is ready. When that occurs, the UETools will be refactored to remove
functions provided by the enclosing framework.
